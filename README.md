 This README provides detailed instructions on setting up the environment, using the script, and understanding its functionalities.
LSB Data Hiding in True Color Images README
Overview

This Python script uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography technique to embed secret messages into true-color BMP images. The script leverages the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to manipulate image pixels and hide information without noticeable changes to the image.
Features

    LSB Embedding: Hides messages within the least significant bits of image pixels.
    Image Integrity: Maintains the original image size and type, ensuring that the changes are imperceptible.
